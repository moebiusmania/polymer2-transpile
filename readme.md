then on browser

### Quick explain
Trying to transpile Polymer 2 to ES5 without the Polymer CLI tool but with a "clean" Webpack + Babel worklfow, since JS files of components are written in separated files.

**polymer.bundle.js** is a JS version of the polymer-element.html file (which contains only JS code...)
